I'm a big fan of phrases, countryisms, and metaphors, so I catalog them here as I find them. (newest first)

<ul>
<li>Show me a woman who's not jealous of another woman, and I'll show you a man</li>
<li>Well dip my balls in sweet cream and squat me in a room full of kitties</li>
<li>I'm as nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs</li>
</ul>
