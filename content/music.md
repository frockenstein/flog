<p>All these songs were written, played and recorded by yours truly (except for the Barry White thing at the very bottom). I usually
just track everything on a laptop with a couple mics. Drums are usually real drums, but sometimes synth drums. Bass I just run through
the guitar amp and guitars are pretty straightforward. I track and mix everything in <a href="http://www.mackie.com/products/tracktion3/splash.html">Tracktion</a>
and master using <a href="http://my.mackie.com/store2/p.asp?p=fm">Final Mix</a>. Enjoy!

		A quick little ditty about those lovely summer days that you don't want to

		I'm gonna miss the things that I take for granted<br>

		My latest. Think my producer skillz are getting better. Seems to have a good punchy clean sound. I'm playing the acoustic a good bit these days and it's showing - takes center stage on this song and the electric's barely audible. Phil Kelly laid down some ridiculously tasty bass for this tune.

		Sucks when the shoes on the other foot now doesn't it?
		<br>Doin' what your doin' just ain't cuttin' it
		<br>Maybe I've grown cold and I am struttin' it

		<br>
		<br>Life sure dealt us a pretty hand now didn't it?
		<br>Throw it down and tilt the crown a little bit
		<br>Took awhile but now I think I'm gettin' it
		<br>And I'll be damned if I give up another mile
		<br>
		<br>The truth is sometimes poison sometimes antidote
		<br>Coat my soul with a heavy layer of creosote
		<br>Gamble it away on a muddy riverboat
		<br>But I'll be damned if I give up another mile
		<br>
		<br>Liberty will breed contempt, why wouldn't it?
		<br>Things remain the same but now they shouldn't fit?
		<br>Wasting all your breath is where you're puttin' it
		<br>And I'll be damned if I give up another mile

		I originally intended this song to have a Brazilian/samba feel to it, but as I fleshed it out, all I could think of was driving down the PCH in a convertible on a sunny evening, so I called it California. I'd been working on this one for a month or so, and I'm fairly proud of it. It has the distinction of being the only song I play castanets on. If you dig this one, you'll probably like <a rel="nofollow" href="#Swirlybird">Swirlybird</a> and <a href="#WaitingForYou" rel="nofollow">Waiting for You</a>.

		Oh I'd like to burn my bills and build a cabin in the hills

		<br>So I move in close to town and let it wear me on down
		<br>And I work all day just to give her what she wants
		<br>
		<br>But sometimes, just sometimes, I wonder what it's like
		<br>To have no more than a backpack and a motorbike
		<br>Either I'm really sinkin', or I'm doing too much thinkin'
		<br>And I need to leave these daydreams alone
		<br>
		<br>Every now and then I'm like a dog inside a pen
		<br>And the urge to run just puts me in a bind
		<br>You could argue that it's safe, and that it's not an awful place
		<br>And I guess there's folks that never really mind
		<br>
		<br>But sometimes, just sometimes, I get all tight and tense
		<br>And I'd like to chew a hole right through that fence
		<br>Yeah, my desire is growin' to go where the wind is blowin'

		A fairly country song about things they might put on my headstone. Musically, there's nothing groundbreaking going on, but I like the lyrics and the structure of the song overall.

		An instrumental that reminds me of a swampy, down and dirty kinda thing. A little like what might happen if Waylon Jennings and Built to Spill jammed. Also reminds me of <a href="http://blip.fm/profile/frockenstein/blip/8275351">Real Good Man</a> by Tim McGraw.

<div class="song-meta">
	<div id="Spacefunk-notes">
		This is an instrumental that to me is somehow futuristic and retro at the same time. The guitarwork is pretty much standard classic rock slide guitar, but the combo of that, the funk beat, and synth gives it a unique flavor I think. Plus I threw in some tribal drums just to further confuse things.

		This is an instrumental that reminds me of the kinda thing you'd hear at the end of a movie, where the camera pans in and around people, going about their business, wrapping things up and showing how it all ended.

		In my late teens I owned a <a title="View a picture of my '69 Cadillac Coupe de Ville" href="/cars#cadillac">'69 Coupe de Ville</a>. Loved the car but it bled me dry so I had to lose her. This song's half about me getting it, half about wanting another one again. It's chock full of countryisms and reminds me a little of Chuck Berry's Maybelline or maybe a Jerry Reed song.

		<br>
		<br>So we hopped into the truck and headed down the road
		<br>I was meant to carry very heavy loads

		<br>Was to lick the bottom of a bureaucrats shoe
		<br>Get 'em when they're old and then they'll leave you be
		<br>Emissions tests - you must be kiddin' me
		<br>Listen to me boys 'cause I know what's cookin'
		<br>Or you can sit there and let me get to bookin'
		<br>
		<br>I need a long, white, loud and tight '69 Cadillac
		<br>If you miss her take a picture boys 'cause I ain't comin' back
		<br>
		<br>We flew down the road a piece and then we hung a right
		<br>Next to her a man whose hair was nearly white
		<br>He said she's been good, but I gotta let her go
		<br>She needs another lover who is in the know
		<br>So fire up the motor son, and let her roar
		<br>She's all power, and style, and badass galore

		A fun little ditty, inspired by my better half. I can't decide if this is a country song or a soul song. Musically, there's nothing Earth-shattering about it, but it features some pretty nice guitar work. The drums also never use a crash or ride cymbal the whole time, which doesn't occur very often in songs. It's all kick, snare, and high-hat only.

		One of my favorites. Production sounds better on this one and I like the "wooziness" and general sadness and depression of it.

		Sauntering down the sidewalk like I usually do
		<br>I was thinking of politics, but mostly of you
		<br>In the grey of December I had a fighting chance
		<br>But I knew it was over after that one last dance
		<br>
		<br>That one last dance, when I kissed your cheek
		<br>You said there's someone I'd like you to meet
		<br>And meet I did, with a surprising end
		<br>And that lovely young lady who was your - girlfriend
		<br>
		<br>My girlfriend's got a girlfriend
		<br>My girlfriend's got a girlfriend
		<br>The pain, the torture
		<br>The thought that I probably bore her
		<br>My girlfriend's got a girlfriend
		<br>
		<br>So I'm standing in the cold, and I'm dreamin' away
		<br>I've been lucky before, but not today
		<br>When I saw you I was hoping to make amends

		Some of the best songs just pop out. I was noodling with this guitar intro, and decided to just record some chords and maybe do some sound tests. One thing led to another and before I new it I had an entire song. I was at the apex of my transition from funk to country and it really shows in this song.

		<br>With my voice hammered, and I'm mired in the truth?

		<br>And killed my dreams and settled all my dirty leins?
		<br>How can one so wet behind the ears be so regretful - much less 30 years

		<br>With my voice hammered, and I'm mired in the truth?

		<br>They say life's meaningless, and even worse to wonder why as I watch 'em die

		<br>Yeah, but it cuts your ass
		<br>I sandpapered a tiger's ass and rode a hog and made a frog's ass watertight
