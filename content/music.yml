    - id: 'MetAGirl'
      title: 'Met a Girl'
      notes: "Like <a href=\"#WaitingForYou\">Waiting for You</a>, this started out as a mic test for some new gear. I decided to keep rolling and drop whatever other acoustic stuff I had in the house. Phil Kelly got a big ol' double bass recently, so that was the missing puzzle piece."

    - id: 'FadingFast'
      title: 'Fading Fast'
      notes: "A quick little ditty about those lovely summer days that you don't want to end. Did this in my living room, and you can hear the metronome bleeding into the mic but I kinda like it - feels like time's ticking away. More basstacular action from Phil Kelly on this one."
      lyrics: |
        I'm gonna miss the things that I take for granted
        Like the salty air and the layer of sand
        That covers me in the summertime
        I'm gonna miss the South and the easy freedom
        And the folks who know to live without feeding
        Off the government
        But it's fading fast
        I'm gonna miss today and it's not even gone
        But the sun is red and the clock marches on
        And I'm losing it
        I hate that things can't always be this perfect
        And I'm not too sure that I even deserve it
        But I hope I do
        But it's fading fast
    - id: 'Another Mile'
      notes: "Think my producer skillz are getting better. Seems to have a good punchy clean sound. I'm playing the acoustic a good bit these days and it's showing - takes center stage on this song and the electric's barely audible. Phil Kelly laid down some ridiculously tasty bass for this tune."
      lyrics: |
        Sucks when the shoes on the other foot now doesn't it?
        Doin' what your doin' just ain't cuttin' it
        Maybe I've grown cold and I am struttin' it
        But I'll be damned if I give up another mile

        Life sure dealt us a pretty hand now didn't it?
        Throw it down and tilt the crown a little bit
        Took awhile but now I think I'm gettin' it
        And I'll be damned if I give up another mile

        The truth is sometimes poison sometimes antidote
        Coat my soul with a heavy layer of creosote
        Gamble it away on a muddy riverboat
        But I'll be damned if I give up another mile

        Liberty will breed contempt, why wouldn't it?
        Things remain the same but now they shouldn't fit?
        Wasting all your breath is where you're puttin' it
        And I'll be damned if I give up another mile

        Don't think about the things you wanna borrow
        Don't think about the things you never had
        Don't think about the things you need tomorrow
        We've all been had
    - id: 'Good+Thing'
      title: 'Good Thing'
      notes: "This one sorta popped out while I was running some mic tests. I'd been kicking the first line around for awhile, and finally found the tune and extra words for it."
      lyrics: |
        If I could go back and do it all again
        I'd find a new way to screw it up and then
        I'd wind up right back where I started from
        Good thing I'm the only one
        I'm a grass-is-always-greener kinda guy
        Sometimes I sit and stare up at the sky
        If the world was full of me we wouldn't get much done
        Good thing I'm the only one
        But it hurts sometimes
        And it makes me sad
        To know I'm gonna lose everything I've ever had
        It hurts sometimes
        When I start to see
        All the things I hope for but won't ever be
    - id: California
      title: California
      notes: I originally intended this song to have a Brazilian/samba feel to it, but as I fleshed it out, all I could think of was driving down the PCH in a convertible on a sunny evening, so I called it California. I'd been working on this one for a month or so, and I'm fairly proud of it. It has the distinction of being the only song I play castanets on. If you dig this one, you'll probably like <a rel="nofollow" href="#Swirlybird">Swirlybird</a> and <a href="#WaitingForYou" rel="nofollow">Waiting for You</a>.
    - id: Daydreams
      title: Daydreams
      notes: This song's for the workin' man. It's another country jam, with a bit of bounce to it and a pretty nice guitar solo if I do say so myself.
      lyrics: |
        Oh I'd like to burn my bills and build a cabin in the hills
        But the wife has doubts that dog will ever hunt
        So I move in close to town and let it wear me on down
        And I work all day just to give her what she wants

        But sometimes, just sometimes, I wonder what it's like
        To have no more than a backpack and a motorbike
        Either I'm really sinkin', or I'm doing too much thinkin'
        And I need to leave these daydreams alone

        Every now and then I'm like a dog inside a pen
        And the urge to run just puts me in a bind
        You could argue that it's safe, and that it's not an awful place
        And I guess there's folks that never really mind

        But sometimes, just sometimes, I get all tight and tense
        And I'd like to chew a hole right through that fence
        Yeah, my desire is growin' to go where the wind is blowin'
        And I need to leave these daydreams alone

        (solo)

        Either I'm really sinkin', or I'm doing too much thinkin'
        And I need to leave these daydreams alone
    - id: Epitaph
      title: Epitaph
      notes: |
        A fairly country song about things they might put on my headstone. Musically, there's nothing groundbreaking going on, but I like the lyrics and the structure of the song overall.

        I recorded the vocals and acoustic guitar with a couple mics in one take, and then sprinkled the bass, drums and electric guitar on afterwards.
      lyrics: |
        I always seem to miss it, by a little less than a minute
        Think I just found a new epitaph

        Things never last for long, and there's always something wrong
        Think I just found a new epitaph

        You never come out cleaner, and always a little bit meaner
        Think I just found a new epitaph

        Not overly corrective, just subtle but effective
        Think I just found a new epitaph

        You work all day and evening, and search in vain for meaning
        Think I just found a new epitaph

        It's never trouble knowing, just hard as shit to get going
        Think I just found a new epitaph
    - id: Swampland
      title: Swampland
      notes: An instrumental that reminds me of a swampy, down and dirty kinda thing. A little like what might happen if Waylon Jennings and Built to Spill jammed. Also reminds me of <a target="_blank" href="http://blip.fm/profile/frockenstein/blip/8275351">Real Good Man</a> by Tim McGraw. I like the mixture of big boomy drums and a funky groove, with some country twang and slide guitar.
    - id: Spacefunk
      title: Spacefunk
      notes: This is an instrumental that to me is somehow futuristic and retro at the same time. The guitarwork is pretty much standard classic rock slide guitar, but the combo of that, the funk beat, and synth gives it a unique flavor I think. Plus I threw in some tribal drums just to further confuse things.
    - id: Montage
      title: Montage
      notes: This is an instrumental that reminds me of the kinda thing you'd hear at the end of a movie, where the camera pans in and around people, going about their business, wrapping things up and showing how it all ended. I believe I was fiddling with the Voc AC-30 amp from <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com/index.php?id=guitarrig3le">Guitar Combos (now Rig I guess)</a> and this one just fell into place.
    - id: Cadillac
      title: Cadillac
      notes: In my late teens I owned a <a title="View a picture of my '69 Cadillac Coupe de Ville" href="/cars#cadillac">'69 Coupe de Ville</a>. Loved the car but it bled me dry so I had to lose her. This song's half about me getting it, half about wanting another one again. It's chock full of countryisms and reminds me a little of Chuck Berry's Maybelline or maybe a Jerry Reed song.
      lyrics: |
        Well I came into some money just the other day
        My old lady knew what I was gonna say
        Flipping through the pages of the Old Car Trader
        I was gonna be as bad as ol' Darth Vader
        Soon and very soon boys I'm gonna shine

        So we hopped into the truck and headed down the road
        I was meant to carry very heavy loads
        But one thing I was never meant to do
        Was to lick the bottom of a bureaucrats shoe
        Get 'em when they're old and then they'll leave you be
        Emissions tests - you must be kiddin' me
        Listen to me boys 'cause I know what's cookin'
        Or you can sit there and let me get to bookin'

        I need a long, white, loud and tight '69 Cadillac
        If you miss her take a picture boys 'cause I ain't comin' back

        We flew down the road a piece and then we hung a right
        Next to her a man whose hair was nearly white
        He said she's been good, but I gotta let her go
        She needs another lover who is in the know
        So fire up the motor son, and let her roar
        She's all power, and style, and badass galore
        I can tell son that you know what's cookin'
        So cut me a check and I'll let you get to bookin'

        I got a long, white, loud and tight '69 Cadillac
        If you miss her, take a picture boys, 'cause I ain't comin' back
    - id: Cutiepie
      title: Cutiepie
      notes: A fun little ditty, inspired by my better half. I can't decide if this is a country song or a soul song. Musically, there's nothing Earth-shattering about it, but it features some pretty nice guitar work. The drums also never use a crash or ride cymbal the whole time, which doesn't occur very often in songs. It's all kick, snare, and high-hat only.
      lyrics: |
        Come on over here cutiepie
        Let me bend your ear cutiepie
        I don't know just what to say
        But I'll flap my gums anyway cutiepie

        I've been watching you cutiepie
        You know a thing or two cutiepie
        I think your shirt is a travesty
        Why don't you slide a little closer to me cutiepie

        Buy us a couple beers cutiepie
        You're just a little weird, but so am I
        I think we might just get along
        Think I might have to sing you a song cutiepie

        You're making me drool cutiepie
        It's getting hard to play it cool cutiepie
        Let's take a nice long ride in the truck
        Find a nice quiet place to... kiss cutiepie
    - id: WaitingForYou
      title: Waiting For You
      notes: This was really just a test song, since I got a couple new mics, but it all just fell together and I liked it so here she is. I think this is the only song here that features some ukelele.
      lyrics: |
        Sitting here waiting for you is like hell
    - id: Remarried
      title: Remarried
      notes: My last recording on my Roland VS-880. Features me on the harmonica this time. It's got a Neil Young feel to it, but I like Neil, so that's no surprise. It's about an old man in Baltimore who's watched life pass him by and kind of wither away. Autobiographical of course :)
      lyrics: |
        I'm a sad, decrepit old man
        With slender, shaky hands
        My signature is not what it used to be

        She left us in '73
        Had somewhere better to be
        A man can only change so much so fast
        A man can only change so much so fast

        The paint store's kept me employed
        The bums they'e kept me annoyed
        My walk to work is not what it used to be

        I moved here when I was a teen
        Ol' formstone made me a king
        But like everything, it's cracked and peeling away
        Like everything, it's cracked and peeling away

        I wish I would have remarried
        Think I should have remarried
        I know I could have remarried
        But it's too late for me to remarry
    - id: Just+Go+Away
      title: Just Go Away
      notes: One of my favorites. Production sounds better on this one and I like the "wooziness" and general sadness and depression of it. I'd been kicking the acoustic guitar outro around for awhile, and one night, house empty, I decided to turn off all the lights, fire up a few candles and see what came out.
      lyrics: |
        Sorry it's come to this
        One thing you always missed
        Is how to nip it in the bud

        So come in and get your shit
        Maybe just one last hit
        Just for old times

        Just go away from me

        Would you mind hurrying up?
        Isn't it just my luck
        It's cold and raining outside

        I know you don't wanna go
        Or touch me, 'cause then you'll know
        How cold I am sometimes

        Just go away
    - id: Fixin'+To+Leave
      title: Fixin' To Leave
      notes: A rockin' country ditty about marital dischord. Dig that twangy solo.
      lyrics: |
        Aaaaaannnnnd now....

        You're fixin' to leave
        I'm fixin' to cry
        Who'll wash my clothes once you've said goodbye?

        You're fixin' to leave
        I'm fixin' to cry
        Who's gonna cook once you've said goodbye?

        Now darlin' don't you wanna come on in
        It's cold outside and this time you can't win
        You're saying you will find a better man
        But I got your car's plugwires in my hand

        You're fixin' to leave
        I'm fixin' to cry
        Who'll wash my clothes once you've said goodbye?

        You're fixin' to leave
        I'm fixin' to cry
        Who's gonna cook once you've said goodbye?

        Now maybe I was wrong to come home late
        And maybe you were right to break those plates
        But did you have to break my heart in two?
        And did I have to break a chair on you?

        And now...
        You're fixin' to leave
        I'm fixin' to cry
        Who's gonna cook once you've said goodbye?

        You're fixin' to leave
        I'm fixin' to cry
        Who'll wash my clothes once you've said goodbye?
    - id: Girlfriend
      title: Girlfriend
      notes: New millenium breakup song. Seems to be the favorite of my family members.
      lyrics: |
        Sauntering down the sidewalk like I usually do
        I was thinking of politics, but mostly of you
        In the grey of December I had a fighting chance
        But I knew it was over after that one last dance

        That one last dance, when I kissed your cheek
        You said there's someone I'd like you to meet
        And meet I did, with a surprising end
        And that lovely young lady who was your - girlfriend

        My girlfriend's got a girlfriend
        My girlfriend's got a girlfriend
        The pain, the torture
        The thought that I probably bore her
        My girlfriend's got a girlfriend

        So I'm standing in the cold, and I'm dreamin' away
        I've been lucky before, but not today
        When I saw you I was hoping to make amends
        But before I could speak in walked your - girlfriend

        My girlfriend's got a girlfriend
        My girlfriend's got a girlfriend
        The pain, the torture
        The thought that I probably bore her
        My girlfriend's got a girlfriend
    - id: Sift
      title: Sift
      notes: Some of the best songs just pop out. I was noodling with this guitar intro, and decided to just record some chords and maybe do some sound tests. One thing led to another and before I new it I had an entire song. I was at the apex of my transition from funk to country and it really shows in this song.
      lyrics: |
        How's it gonna be when I'm long in the tooth
        With my voice hammered, and I'm mired in the truth?
        After I've cheated and lied and cried
        And killed my dreams and settled all my dirty leins?
        How can one so wet behind the ears be so regretful - much less 30 years
        How's it gonna be when I'm long in the tooth
        With my voice hammered, and I'm mired in the truth?

        They say life's meaningless, and even worse to wonder why as I watch 'em die
        And then my tender hands betray me as I sift through their remains

        I'm curious if work is necessary to get past
        Yeah, but it cuts your ass
        I sandpapered a tiger's ass and rode a hog and made a frog's ass watertight
        And then they say I'm ready for the secret of life
        It is: always carry a knife
        And their tender hands betray them when they sift through my remains
    - id: Let's+Get+Away
      title: Let's Get Away
      notes: I don't know what I did right, but my guitar sound is nothing but the truth on this song. The solo's not half bad either, and it's got a pseudo bass solo thrown in there just for good measure.
      lyrics: |
        Heart why do you pain me so?
        Dreams why don't you let me go?
        It's cold outside and grey
        I got one thing to say
        Let's get away

        It kills me to see
        You beg and plead to be free
        You're spinning your wheels
        Looking tired - propped by ideals
        It's cold outside and grey
        I got one thing to say
        Let's get away

        The warm morning sun
        Passed me by 'cause I'm on the run
        I no longer care
        To see you there - empty stare
        It's cold outside and grey
        I got one thing to say
        Let's get away
    - id: Swirlybird
      title: Swirlybird
      notes: This one's an instrumental, and it came as I was getting into country guitar playing, especially trying to mimic pedal-steel stuff. That and the Leslie effect I was fiddling with at the time give it a unique, kind of country, kind of jazzy feel.
    - id: Time+and+Chance
      title: Time and Chance
      notes: The best laid plans... I was fond of this sort of swirly, reso-filter kind of guitar sound at the time. Also tried to add some drum-n-bass type of drums to it, which might have come out okay if I was a better drummer. I over-compressed things on this track, but I like the overall structure and the lyrics to it.
      lyrics: |
        Sweetheart's young, knows where she's going
        So she thought until she started showing
        Sinking fast and desperately rowing

        Her old man just sits and sighs
        He can't stand to look her in the eyes
        It happened to him and his second wife

        Some guys play with made up guns
        My best friend's still on the run
        'Cause she said babe you're not the one
        Broken hearts most always heal
        Love makes you think it's such a steal
        But goddamn it's a sorry deal
        And you bow out to time and chance

        And what do you do when you wake up?
        What do you say when you wake up?

        I just wanted a General Lee
        And a dad, but I got three
        Found out college wasn't for me

        It's not that we all don't give it a shot
        Just never take the time to ask why not
        Everybody thinks they know the dance
        And they bow to time and chance
        We bow out to time and chance
    - id: StupidFool
      title: Stupid Fool
      notes: I just remastered this one recently, using Final Mix. This is a pretty decent pop song about being in love with someone who's no good for you. I'd like to redo the whole thing soon and get a real up-front/in-your-face sound to it.
      lyrics: |
        See you there, looking so fine
        And to think you're such a hard time
        I used wonder how to make you mine
        Turns out you're the farthest thing from kind

        But I'm in love with you and it's a sign that I'm a stupid fool

        Some say I like the abuse
        And then you smile and I get confused
        A rainy day hiding the sun
        But at it's worst, it's still a lot of fun

        But I'm in love with you and it's a sign that I'm a stupid fool

        I gotta tell you that beautiful girls are a pain in the ass
        Beautiful girls are a pain in the ass

        Spend my bones on clothes and hair
        Too lazy to look elsewhere
        Fine woman you're a blessing and a curse
        I'd be ungrateful, but you got there first

        But I'm in love with you and it's a sign that I'm a stupid fool
    - id: Dirt
      title: Dirt
      notes: You can really hear my bossa influence here. I love the lyrics to this. It's not often I think that about my own songs, but these stand out to me for some reason.
      lyrics: |
        I hate to say it now
        We've drifted apart somehow
        We've both done our part
        But this is just the start

        I stayed because of guilt
        I watched my heart just die and wilt
        It shows in the air
        It shows in lonely stares

        You're right to call me shit
        I dug a hole and fell in it
        I thought it was love
        Just ended up in dirt

        I never thought I'd lie
        Or leave you sitting high and dry
        I swore to the stars
        But they weren't listening
        They weren't listening
    - id: Poets
      title: Poets
      notes: Great spanish-y guitar solo on this one. Sometimes it's fun to crank the amp and just holler.
      lyrics: |
        My girlfriend says she loves me immensely
        She's a filthy liar
        Ignoring every goddamn thing she hurls at me
        And God it's making me tired

        'Cause I can't tell a poet from a prophet, so I listen to both, and baby you're neither     one
        I can't tell a poet from a prophet, so I listen to both, and baby you're neither one

        I'm swimming in my own filth
        My heart spilled on the ground
        I'm cleaning up today and you know what I'm about to say
        That I don't want you around

        'Cause I can't tell a poet from a prophet, so I listen to both, and baby you're neither     one

    - id: TestFunk
      title: Testfunk
      notes: Reminds me of a 70s car chase song. The drums are synth drums, but I'm proud of them. They've got a great natural feel and nasty beat. It takes some time to tweak a beat and get it to sound less mechanized, but it's worth it. Pay attention to the crash cymbals coming in on odd beats.

      title: Playing Your Game
      notes: A "remix" of a Barry White song. Just an instrumental rearrangement, but nice music for friskiness.
    - id: Battery
      title: Battery
      notes: Named after the Native Instruments plugin that I was fiddling with to get this song. It's not much of anything, but it does have 3 drum tracks, and funky ones at that. You don't hear that everyday...
