<p>Here's a great snippet from a <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/autos/autobeat/archives/2008/12/toyota_delays_n.html?campaign_id=rss_daily">Businessweek article</a> (emphasis mine):</p> <blockquote>In another sign of how seriously Watanabe and his team are taking the current crisis, reports over the weekend say Toyota <b>may cut board member bonuses to zero</b> for the current financial year, saving a further $11 million. While that seems reasonable, given the circumstances, itâ€™s notable that <b>Japanese execs earned far less than counterparts at Detroit rivals</b> during the good times. Last year, Toyota says it paid its 25 most senior executives a combined $33 million in salary and bonuses. <b>Ford paid its CEO Alan Mulally alone over $20 million in 2007 in salary, bonuses and stock options while GM chief Rick Wagoner pocketed $15.7 million.</b></blockquote> <p>The Detroit guys wonder why they're going out of business. They <i>need</i> to go out of business. They're about as fat, dumb and happy as you can get and could use a few buckets of cold reality dumped on 'em.
