        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>use dielectric grease on most any electrical connection. inside
spark plug wires, connectors, smear it on battery terminals before
making a connection</li>
          <li>use anti-seize compound on most heavy duty, or high-heat threaded
situations: lugnuts, exhaust manifold bolts, spark plug threads...</li>
          <li>rotate and balance your tires relatively often (I think 7000 mi. is normal). you'll get more life out of them by far.</li>
          <li>using a thicker oil on older cars can help with leaks and
compression. I've generally had good luck on my old clunkers using
20w-50 or even straight 50 (usually marketed as racing oil).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Car Questions</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>What do different oil numbers mean?</dt>
          <dd>The first number is how it acts in the winter. A lower number
indicates that it's a thinner oil. In the winter, when the oil is cold,
it's not as viscous (slippery). The opposite is true for the summer
when it's hot: it kinda thins out from the heat. So the ideal oil would
be one that acts thin in the winter and thick in the summer. Well,
wouldn't you know that some fart smeller, I mean smart feller, would
come up with it? That's what happened. So a 20w-50 oil would act like a
20 weight in the <b>w</b>inter, and a 50 weight in the summer. 10w-30
is a pretty common weight. Some of the newer cars with their tighter
tolerances use even a 5w-30.</dd>
          <dt>What type of gas should I use</dt>
          <dd>Whatever your owner's manual says. Most cars: 87 octane</dd>
          <dt>What is octane?</dt>
          <dd>It's sort of like a quality rating on gasoline. Higher octane is
more refined. It burns more consistently. It doesn't make any more
power than normal gas. Race cars and the like use high octane (usually
100+ octane) not because it's <i>magical</i> but because it's higher quality. They can't tolerate detonation and inconsistent burning that would come from pump gas. <br /></dd>
          <dt>Do you recommend Rain-X for your windshield?</dt>
          <dd>Absolutely. They even make window washer fluid now that does pretty much the same thing?<br /></dd>
          <dt>What about fuel system treatments?</dt>
          <dd>I use 'em, but only every now and then. I've never dumped a bottle in and said "Wow! I can feel an extra 10 horsepower now!"<br /></dd>
          <dt>What about antifreeze?</dt>
          <dd>
            <b>Always</b> use a 50/50 mixture of antifreeze. 100% antifreeze
actually performs worse than when mixed with water. By the same token,
100% water doesn't cut it. The antifreeze, on top of keeping your
engine from freezing and cracking, has stuff in it that lubricates and
keeps your internal bits and pieces happy. It's a good idea to change
your antifreeze once a year. Most Jiffy-Lube-type outfits have a
radiator flush that's pretty cheap, and you can avoid some cooling
system headaches by doing this simple thing.</dd>
          <dt>Is there such thing as too much horsepower?</dt>
          <dd>No</dd>
          <dt>How do diesel engines work?</dt>
          <dd>Diesels are mostly like gas engines, except they don't have spark
plugs. The piston compresses the fuel and air so hard that it explodes
and forces the piston back down. Diesel fuel is much less refined than
gasoline too. You can even use kerosene in a pinch. Both aren't very
refined, and usually cheaper because of it. I'm not exactly sure why
diesels are so much torquier than gas engines, but they are. You could
never win a drag race in a diesel, but you could pull a stump out of
the ground with it. They tend to get pretty good fuel mileage too. I
wish more vehicles had them.</dd>
        </dl>***<br /><br />Leaking fork seals on a dirtbike from (<a href="http://www.off-road.com/dirtbike/nov00mxtuner.html">http://www.off-road.com/dirtbike/nov00mxtuner.html</a>): <br /><blockquote>One
of the nice things about a seal driver is that it is made of steel and
the weight of the tool helps hammer the seals into place. PVC pipe
would work in a pinch but for what it costs to have one fork leg seal
replaced, you can own the correct seal driver.<br /><br />I have NEVER been
able to get leakproof seals to work and heaven knows I tried. I won't
use them. I would suggest getting a cartridge holder also. This tool
makes it possible to remove the cartridge without air tools. If you're
going to replace the fork seals, remove the cartridge and flush out all
the old oil. Removing the cartridge is the only way to correctly change
the fork oil. You can not get out the contaminants by turning the fork
upside down and pumping the damper rod.<br /><br />One alternative to the
seal is the business card trick. Try this before you spring for a new
seal. Remove the fork guard. Gently pry the dust seal down so you can
see the oil seal. With the bike on a crate type stand; remove the air
bleed screw to relieve any pressure. Now take the end of a business
card and push it between the fork tube and the sealing lip of the seal.
With the end of the card under the seal lip, rotate it around the tube,
trying to drag any dirt out with the card. Take some aerosol brake
cleaner and rinse out the area between the oil and dust seals. You'd be
amazed at how many seals can be brought back to life with this method.<br /></blockquote></div>
