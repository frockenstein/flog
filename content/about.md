<h4>What's a "slipangle"?</h4>
It' a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_angle" title="slipangle definition on wikipedia">racing term</a> that means the difference between where your tire is pointing vs where your tire is going. I like it as a metaphor for life: the difference between where you think your going and where you're really going.

<h4>Nuts and Bolts</h4>
This site's built on <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>. As soon as I heard about it and watched a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ztr-HhWX1c">campfire video</a> they did, I knew I had to get in there and play with it. I love coding and building websites, but hate all the rest: hosting, databases, caching, dns, email, etc. Plus, I've always been <a href="/tips-python">intrigued by Python</a>, so it was a good chance to play with a new language. The old version of this site was in C# and was an experiment on making a dynamic site with as few files as possible. It was one default.aspx page and one xml file. <a href="http://sinatra.rubyforge.org/">Sinatra</a> looks pretty cool too. Had I known about it when I was building this site, I might have gone that route.</p>

<p>One big catch in converting the site over to App Engine was the fact that Google limits the size of your files, and since I put <a href="/music">my songs up here</a> too, I had to figure out hosting for them, but I'd also been wanting to noodle with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>, so that was a no-brainer. My hosting costs have gone from about $10 a month with <a href="http://brinkster.net">Brinkster</a> to maybe ¢20 (just for S3 - App Engine's free). Also, since I've jumped ship to Mac, and use Transmit for FTP, <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2007/08/31/transmit-gets-s3-support">they have S3 support built right in</a>, so it's all been gravy so far. I've been taking <a href="http://git.or.cz" target="_blank">Git</a> a spin for version control too. For most of what I do (lone-wolf developer, a handful of commits, not much branching), I don't notice much advantage of Git over Subversion, but it works well and its easy to use with <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>
