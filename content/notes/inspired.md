A good project manager: urgency, frame & context, clear thinking, data driven, decisive, good judgment, good attitude

Design & UX: interaction, visual, prototyping, testing. Interplay between users, QA, designers, builders

Right Product vs Product Right
* keep engineering involved early
* keep design & prod involved late
* smallest viable product first
* minimize churn once dev starts
* flush out questions early

Product Manager:
* Give 20% for dev to rewrite and refactor
* Customer empathy & product passion
* Hard working & take work home - it’s a holistic problem
* Integrity
* Confidence - attitude
* Know the tech
* Focus on the main thing
* Manage time & distinguish between important and not
* Good writer and speaker
* Product management is tough & everything rides on ‘em - choose wisely
* Tell design & dev what product needs to do - let them solve it
* Give fellow employees anonymous shoutouts. Describe under appreciated people and strengths

Managing and management
* Measure and plan for churn, but minimize churn
* Product opportunities
	* What will this solve?
	* Target market
	* Market size
	* How do we measure success
	* Competition
	* Why us? Differentiator
	* Why now?
	* Product-to-market strategy
	* What’s critical to success
	* Go or no go?

Discovery vs Execution
* Once in execution mode, minimize invention and churn
* If need be, start a parallel 2.0 version once 1.0 goes into build mode

Product Council
* Keep to 10 or less
* Milestone 1: select opportunities to be investigated
* Milestone 2: review & issue go/no-go
* Milestone 3: Review prototypes, test results, cost estimates
* Milestone 4: review final product, QA, launch status
* Charter user program (beta testers)
	* They don’t pay you for it
	* Don’t just let everyone in - be choosy & get the right folks
	* If nobody wants in, your product sucks
	* Make sure they’re your target market (not early adopter)
	* Reinforce that it’s not a custom solution
	* Treat them as colleagues
* Market research
	* Use surveys, analytics, data mining, over-the-shoulder watching, competitive * analysis
	* Product discovery is: what tech can we use to solve this problem in a better way, * what should the experience be?
	* Winning products come from deep understanding of needs and capabilities
	* Focus groups suck because: customers don’t know what’s possible or what they want
	* Use personas and try to be in customers’ shoes

Specs
* Should describe interaction
* Represent behavior
* Communicate requirements to all groups (qa, eng., etc.)
* Needs to be a single master spec
* Use a hi-fi prototype - not a massive Word doc

Design & Implementation
* Don’t do UX & implementation simultaneously
* Don’t wait for beta to test designs
* Prototype software should be easily trashed & changed in hours
* UX can’t be stubbed out like code
* Designers can be pressured for time & deliver half-baked UX
* Keep engineering the the loop to assess feasibility

Minimal Product
* Product manager and designer come up with prototype of minimum functionality
* Engineering should represent to point out pitfalls & constraints
* Test prototype with target users
* This forces you to think upfront about min. product & you can’t severely cut or change * later on
* Only then do you start building & slip release if snagged

Validation
* Feasibility testing: what’s possible and what does it cost?
* Usability testing: test on real people
* Value testing: is it valuable?

Prototyping
* Round up test subjects
* Define tasks to test
* Start them from zero - don’t provide extra context. This lets you see how they think * about the problem outside of your solution
* See if they can figure out what it does & how it works at first glance - or if they * notice the important parts
* Only now do you begin having a conversation
* Ask about net promoter. Would they recommend it? If so, you’ve got value
* Ask how much they’d pay for it
* Ask what they’d expect to happen if they hit a dead end

Prototyping/Testing Environment
* Record them if possible
* Go to their office
* Face-to-face is preferable
* Product manager should be there - don’t delegate this
* One administers, another takes notes
* Don’t butter users up - you want an untainted opinion
* You’re testing a prototype - your feelings won’t be hurt, & they can’t pass/fail - * only the prototype
* You’re testing use & value - not design
* Keep quiet
* Either they a) did it easily, b) hunted but eventually did it or c) gave up
* Don’t lead the witness
* No running narration of what they’re thinking
* Parrot them
* You’re looking for problems spots - inconsistent with how they think
* +/- 6 users that can do the taks is a signal that it works
* Unusable/unclear doesn’t equal failure - you’ve saved a ton of time and resources

Improving Existing Products
* Decide what metrics are important & breathe them
* Analytics & changes that actually move the needle
* Study & work the numbers

Gentle Deployment
* Don’t be too disruptive with releases
* Parallel deployment - opt in to the new style (or the reverse)

Rapid Response
* Don’t quit after launch
* Assume there will be issues & be prepared to handle them

Agile Success
* Product manager is product owner - anything else is folly
* Stay 1 or 2 sprints ahead of team
* Break work into small, manageable chunks
* Let engineering break work up however they see fit
* Manager/owner & UX at every standup - constant previewing & presenting
* End of sprint doesn’t necessarily = launch - product has to be ready & gentle deploy * considered
* Make sure everyone understands agile

Large Companies
* It’s harder there
* Big companies are risk-averse
* Skunk works & just get it done

Fear, Greed, & Lust
* Understand the human side of a product
* Try to speak more directly to these emotions

Do’s
* Have a product manager
* UX is all-important
* Assess before jumping in
* Charter users
* Product principles
* Personas
* Discovery: value, usable, feasible
* Prototype
* Test prototype with real users
* Measure to improve - not just by adding features

Always Ask
* Is it compelling
* Is it easy to use as humanly possible?
* Will it succeed against future competition
* Do I know people who’ll really buy this?
* Is it truly different?
* Will it actually work?
* Is it a whole product, consistent with how we’ll sell it?
* Are the strengths lined up with what’s important? Are we working those strengths?
* Is it worth the money?
* Are my views inline with the rest of the team about what’s important?
