## Manager Stuff

#### Every manager must know what goes on in their domain

This becomes a vice when carried to the extent of impeding operations, but in general, the more information you have the more effectively you can manage your business.

#### Don't try to do it all yourself

You should be able to go away on vacation and things work just fine. It's part of your job to develop young talent so don't use "they're too green" as an excuse. Do this by loading them up with all they can carry without being dangerous or embarrassing. On the other hand, serious things will require top programmers and skills.

#### Put first things first in applying yourself to your job

There isn't time for everything, so do important stuff first. Important = things you're held directly accountable for. A rule of thumb is never do something minor that you can get someone else to do. Experts (other departments, consultants, etc) will usually be faster and better at getting answers to things. It's often wise to limit yourself to only those things where you can bring some special talent or have a natural advantage.

#### Cultivate the habit of "boiling matters down" to their simplest terms

Some people seem disposed to muddying the water. Make it a practice to condense, summarize and simplify.

#### Don't get excited in engineering emergencies - keep your feet on the ground

Most crises aren't as bad as they seem at first. Don't ignore signs of trouble, but learn to distinguish between isolated cases and real epidemics. Get the facts first, then act as soon as you have enough evidence to reach a sound decision.

#### Engineering meetings should neither be too large nor too small

Large meetings frequently suck and considerable skill is required to keep them from digressing. This tendency is usually proportional to the size of the meeting.

Small meetings can usually hammer things out more effectively, but there's a serious possibility that interested parties won't be represented, and "considerable mischief" may result. Apart from actual bad decisions, rework and the like, strong resentments may be aroused.

One good strategy is to call in key individuals when their part is being discused. Another is to limit the meeting to two layers of the org chart.

In any meeting it's important to face issues and dispose of them. Count any meeting a failure if they don't end up with a clear idea of who's doing what, when.

#### Cultivate the habit of making brisk, clean-cut decisions

This is the most difficult and important part of a manager's job. A few key principles:

1. Decicions will be easier and more often right if you have the essential facts at hand. Stay well informed. If you don't have all the facts, ask yourself "Am I likely to lose more by giving a snap judgement vs waiting?"
2. [Form principles in advance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCrKErEYwJE).
3. You don't have to be right all the time. Just 51+% of the time. Higher % will serve you proportionally better.
4. A difficult decision usually means it's a wash and the loss won't be big either way. Make the call and see it through.
5. It's futile to try keeping everyone happy. Give everyone a fair hearing and then dispose of the matter.

When indecision occurs ask yourself:

* Does it expedite the undertaking or produce procrastination and delay?
* Is it fair and aboveboard?
* Is it in line with established custom or policy? A good reason is required for a departure.
* Is it in line with a previous decision? Even a good reason to make a change may get you the impression of instability.
* What are the odds? Can we accept the risk? How does the penalty compare to the gain?

Don't let a possible mistake inhibit you. Take *good* risks, take your medicine when you lose. Mistakes can often be turned to profit, if only for the experience.

#### Don't overlook the value of suitable preparation before announcing a major decision or policy

When time permits, discuss things in advance with key personnel. Embarrassment and bad feelings otherwise.

### Managing Design and Dev Projects

#### Learn project management skills and techniques and apply them to things you manage

1. Define the objectives
2. Plan the job by:
    * outlining steps to accomplish
    * define required people, money, etc
    * prepare a definite schedule
3. Execute the plan
4. Monitor the progress and respond to deviations
    * Watch for logjams, hit lagging items HARD with additional time, people, money.
    * Revise your schedule as needed
5. Drive to finish on time

#### Plan your dev work so far enough ahead of production so as to meet schedules without a wild last-minute rush.

Production planning is a common and devilish error. It's important to plan early enough to involve the necessary stages, and can make the construction phase go way smoother.

#### Beware of seeking too much comfort in planning your engineering programs

Too much preoccupation with stability and security will often lead to greater danger and _insecurity_. In a competitive world you must take chances - others certainly will and you'll be out of breath trying to catch up. Undertake stiff development programs setting a high mark. A good shop will work its way out of a tight spot under the pressure of emergency. Have an aggro program or goal, but also have a fallback to hedge against failure. Don't go all in. This lets you go after bigger stakes while limiting the downside.

#### Be content to freeze a design when the development has progressed far enough

Not always easy to agree on "far enough," but in general get it to a shippable state and go. Design usually will tweak too much and make things late. Can always make improvements in the next round.

#### Constantly review projects to make certain that actual benefits are in line with costs in money time, personnel.

Projects frequently are carried along by Newton's first law of motion long after they could yield a good return on the investment. If it's not paying off, time to kill or alter the project. Think of a stock that's just not working out: you could put that money to use elsewhere.

#### Make it a rule to require, and submit, regular periodic progress reports, as well as final reports on completed projects

It's tedious, but you're not organized and controlled until you do this. Nothing is quite as compelling and effective as requiring an engineer to keep the facts assembled and appraised. These reports are as useful for the writer as the reader.

An engineering project is not really finished until it's properly summarized.

### On organizational structures

#### Make sure that everyone has been assigned definite positions and responsibilities within the organization

It's bad for morale when people don't know what they're responsible for. Don't keep tentative org changes hanging over people. Changing them later is better than leaving people in poorly defined positions. Some orgs have a technical manager as well as an administrative manager. Does leave open the possibility of competition for allegiance among managers to reports.

#### Make sure everyone has the authority they need to execute their jobs and meet their responsibilities

Authority must be commensurate with responsibility. Bestowing this authority is difficult and delicate - add enough to make someone effective, with out making them dangerous. Often people are held responsible for more than they can control and this is a shame. Encourage yourself and subordinates to assume, delicately, as much authority as needed to do the job.

#### Make sure that all activities and all individuals are supervised by someone competent in the subject matter involved

At high levels in other orgs, supervisors often have dissimilar training and experience, but in an engineering org, ideally people should be supervised be seasoned vets in their area.

A good method is to complement yourself with people who are better in some areas, who can shore up any breaks in your expertise.

Another good method is to assign technical responsibilities to someone and make them consultants for others.

Recognize the limitations in how many subordinates a person can have. 6-7 is the guideline, but don't be rigid here.

### What all managers owe their employees

#### Never misrepresent a subordinate's performance during performance appraisals

It's crucial to review the performance of your reports. It's also crucial to talk things over as soon as something disagreeable happens. If you fire someone for incompetence it means you've also failed.

#### Make it unquestionably clear what is expected of employees

Number 1 on the list of required communication between manager and report are expectations of the job. Set down goals and expectations and follow up with monitoring and support.

#### Promote the personal and professional interests of your employees on all occasions

Not an obligation, but an opportunity and privilege. It's up to managers to reconcile and merge what employees want and what the company wants. It's best when employees get a square deal, plus a little extra consideration on occasions.

#### Do not hang on to employees too selfishly when they are offered a better opportunity elsewhere

Don't thwart them, or try to keep them with you if it's gonna make you look bad when they leave. You should always be training backups for key personnel, including yourself.

#### Don't short-circuit or override your subordinates if you can possibly avoid it

It's your prerogative, but can be demoralizing and should be a last resort. You can do irreparable damage by exercising authority without sufficient knowledge of the details of the matter.

#### You owe it to your subordinates to keep them properly informed

Responsibility without information is horrible - only one notch above responsibility without authority. Inform people of past history, present status, future plans of a project. Hold occasional meetings to update on major policies and developments in the biz. Include engineers in lunches, introductions, trips, etc. to get them the knowledge they need to do a job.

#### Don't criticize a subordinate in front of others, especially their own subordinates

Many times a problem can be traced back to your failure to advise, warn or train properly.

#### Show an interest in what your employees are doing

It's discouraging when the boss has no interest in their work, failing to inquire, comment or otherwise. A little effort goes a long way - make the effort.

#### Never miss a chance to commend or reward for a job well done

A first-rate manager is a leader as well as a critic. The better part of your job is to stimulate employees. By all means, get tough when the situation justifies it, but too much criticism, or too much lenience will sour them.

#### Always accept full responsibility for your group and the individuals in it

Never pass the buck. You're supposed to have control and are credited with the success as well as the failure of your group.

#### Do all you can to see that your subordinates get all of the salary to which their entitled

Pay increases, however they happen, are the most appropriate reward for outstanding work, greater responsibility, or increased value to the company.

#### Do all you can to protect the personal interests of your subordinates and their families

Most folks will appreciate your honest, unprying interest in their lives outside of the workplace, and your support as well if they have difficulties. Try to accomodate them when justifiable. You have the right to inconvenience your employees but also the responsibility to avoid doing so when possible.
