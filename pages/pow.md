title: Pow! Lyrics
---
I've had a devil of a time finding lyrics for this song online, and I can't say I'm surprised, since the thing goes a million miles an hour, but after tons of listening I think I've come pretty close. Still a little hazy on the chorus though. If you've got corrections or suggestions, <a href="mailto:jason@slipangle.org">email me</a>.

<b>The Lovin' Spoonful</b> - "Pow!"<br /><br />I've always been the guy with the finger in his nose when the passport picture gets taken<br />When the big guys took me out stealin' chickens it was me caught holdin' the bacon<br />When they're droppin' a piano from the 47th floor I'm the guy underneath lookin' up<br />And when the tidal wave strikes 100 miles at sea I'm always at the rail throwin' up<br /><br />Whee then Pow!<br />Somehow I woulda met you anyhow<br />You fix it up and then holy cow<br />You folks are gonna see me now<br /><br />I was standing in an artsy-fartsy uptown restaurant a few frozen dinners ago<br />When I stumbled on a waiter full of crepe suzettes and I ran out the door flambeau<br />Then I ran down to chinatown got myself some soy sauce & grabbed some moo goo gai pan to go<br />When I got wiped out by a stray beansprout that was landin' on the floor<br /><br />Whee then Pow!<br />
Somehow I woulda met you anyhow<br />
You fix it up and then holy cow<br />
You folks are gonna see me now<br /><br />Well I finally got so fed up I was off to blow my head off with the gun inside the cash drawer of the store<br />Then I thought I grabbed the pistol just in case I was successful but instead I got my tie caught in the drawer<br />When your riding down the road at 100 miles an hour and the guy can't sit you someplace<br />Honey don't you be surprised I'll be wipin out my eyes as you pass by leavin' dust dust in my face<br /><br />Whee then Pow!<br />

Somehow I woulda met you anyhow<br />

You fix it up and then holy cow<br />

You folks are gonna see me now<br />
