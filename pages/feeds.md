<h4>What's a "feed"?</h4>
<p>Basically, you can subscribe to content from this website. This is an RSS icon <img src="/images/rss.gif" /> - RSS stands for <b>R</b>eally <b>S</b>imple <b>S</b>yndication, and it's a format that various programs can understand. I prefer <a href="http://google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> these days, but most browsers can handle RSS now, Outlook can, etc.</p>

<h4>How Does it Work</h4>

<p>When you subscribe to my feed, your feed reader will automatically notify you when I update the site. When you fire it up, it grabs all your feeds and checks for things you haven't seen. This way, you can keep track of many sites with minimal effort on your part. Studies show that nearly 100% of the cool kids, wherever they may reside, are using RSS feeds, therefore you should as well.</p>

<h4>Hook It Up!</h4>
<ul>

<li><img src="/images/rss.gif" /> <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/Slipangle">The Usual</a> - Blog posts from this site. This is the Honda Accord of my site's content: sturdy, reliable, updated often, but not <i>too</i> often.<br /><br /></li>


<li><img src="/images/rss.gif" /> <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/SlipangleFirehose">The Firehose</a> - Everything (good for stalkers or family). My blog posts, Flickr, Del.icio.us, Twitter... The whole 9.<br /><br /></li>


<li><img src="/images/rss.gif" /> Tag Feeds - Entries are categorized by tag (ie: <a href="/tags/music">music</a>), and you can subscribe to a feed of just those things. <b>Tip</b>: you can combine tags together like so: <a href="/tags/music+cars">music+cars</a>, and get a feed of the categories you're interested in. You can <a href="/tags">view all tags here</a>.</li>
</ul>
