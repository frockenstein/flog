	We're having some technical difficulties over here at <a href="/">Slipangle.org</a>, and 
	on behalf of our 7,000 employees in 10 offices worldwide, we'd like to offer our sincere
	apologies. We've got a crack team of engineers and scientists working on the issue, even
	pulling a few from our secret government skunkworks projects, so things should be rectified
	momentarily. Or never - whichever comes first.
