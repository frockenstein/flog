What's a Rictionary? A <i>redneck dictionary</i> of course.<br /><br />Ever since I saw Foxworthy do this on his show, my own additions crop up once in awhile. Like to hear it, here it go...<br /><br />
<b>Onna</b> - going to: <i>I'm onna cut yo' butt you sumbitch</i><br /><br />
<b>Demarra</b> - The day after today: <i>I can't be there this afternoon, so it's gonna have to be demarra.</i><br /><br /><b>Jew</b> - as in: <i>Jew see that fox run acrost that powerline?!</i><br /><br /><b>Mayonnaise</b> - as in: <i>Mayonnaise about 14 kids runnin' wild in this house!</i><br /><br /><b>Sposta</b> - something you have to do: <i>I'm sposta go to work today, but damn if I don't wanna go!</i><br />    <br />        <br />
