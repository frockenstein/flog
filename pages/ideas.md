<p>These aren't necessarily my original ideas, just a place to park things that might be cool or we need to see more of.</p>-- tattoo of a Rorschach test: great pickup potential, only gets better with age<br /><br />-- "there's 3 kindsa people in this world: those who can count, and those who can't"<br /><br />-- a quilt made out of panties<br /><br />-- I gotta "mule it over"<br /><br />-- guitar pickups that look like swiss army knives<br /><br />-- Restaurant placemats are crossword puzzles<br /><br />-- Seat covers for girls bikes of famous hunks<br /><br />-- A coffee table with family pics under glass or shellac<br /><br />-- Ivy as a solution to graffiti<br /><br />-- "The Weather Is Here - Wish You Were Beautiful!"<br /><br />-- "what in carnation instant breakfast?!" (goes nicely with "Judas H Priest!")<br /><br />
-- skeet golf: 2 vs. 2, one drives the golf ball, the other shoots it.
best out of 20 wins the round, best out of 5 rounds wins the match.
every round, the teammates have to switch between who shoots and who
drives.<br /><br />
-- a watch with a speedometer for the clockface (why is this so hard to find?)<br /><br />
-- A reading lamp made from a mic stand and hollowed out mic <br /><br /> --
bathroom doors with colored indicators (indicators of color) that tell
you if someone's in there: when the door is locked, the color shows
red, when unlocked, green. <br /><br /> -- classical or oldies playing in public restrooms, or classical playing everywhere for that matter. <br /><br /><!--- a bath sponge cutout in the shape of a microphone <br /><br />- an electric chair for your phone when it's charging <br /><br />--> -- a washing machine that's also the dryer (why is this not standard?!)<br /><br />--
elevator buttons that place highest priority on whoever pushes the
button fastest (like video games) also see horror/drama movies    <br />
