<p>I find myself liking Grateful Dead songs these days. I never really <i>disliked</i> them, but I don't know, for some reason it just occurred to me that they were a good band. I couldn't quite understand why some folks made such a big fuss about them. I've also gotten a few <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref%255F%3Dnb%255Fss%255F%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dcanned%2520heat%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&tag=slipangleorg-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">Canned Heat</a> songs recenlty, so maybe a pattern's forming with me and these San Francisco bands. <p>I guess if you think about it, bands like The 'Dead, Canned Heat, Creedence, etc. were all pretty much the same: blues/country-based rock bands from San Francisco. The Dead kinda have a life and aura all their own now, but I bet back in the 60s they didn't seem all that different from a band like Creedence. I bet Fogerty and Garcia could have jammed for awhile on some old bluegrass or folk tunes. <a href="/blog/becoming-the-beatles">As I've written before</a>, I think it's a shame that bands today don't have the wide range of influences that bands of the past did. Would the Dead have sounded <i>anything</i> like they did without the jazz influence, the country/gospel harmonizing, etc.? Not a chance.</p>
